### My Takeaway
The process from purchase to course initiation was seamless. After purchasing the course, I received all necessary emails and access credentials promptly. Upon entering the learning portal, I found clear details about the course objectives, certification process, lab access, and exam structure.

The introductory modules, while comprehensive, presented a high volume of information spanning multiple topics. For students, especially beginners, this might feel overwhelming. Structuring the course to tackle each subject individually, with smaller modules combining theory, practical exercises, or video demonstrations, would make the content more digestible and engaging.
The course material itself was largely well-constructed, with solid information to support both video tutorials and lab exercises. Although I noticed a few duplicated pages and occasional errors in titles, these issues were minor and did not detract significantly from the overall learning experience.
The course covers the previous described topics.

The self-practice lab setup process was straightforward, with access generated automatically upon submitting a request in the portal. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by some technical issue, which did not seem intentional from the write-up or lab walkthorugh videos. I had to employ workarounds to gain initial access, abit different from the intended experience.
Additionally, the state of the lab differed slightly from the provided write-up, which created some minor discrepancies when following along with the course material. Despite that, the course offers multiple support resources, such as write-ups and video tutorials, that guide students through the practical aspects of the lab, helping them overcome challenges.

Scheduling the exam required at least two days' notice, which is reasonable, though same-day scheduling would have been a welcome option. The support team was accommodating, allowing flexibility in scheduling around personal commitments.
The exam began smoothly, with an email containing the scope and VPN details arriving ahead of the scheduled time. While taking the exam, I encountered intermittent connectivity issues during network pivoting. Although these issues had a minor impact, they were frustrating. Till this day, I_m not sure if it was intended but with enough experience is possible to workaround it.
During the 24-hour exam, I contacted support around 7 PM due to a suspected issue with the environment. Unfortunately, I didn’t receive a response until nearly 6 AM—a delay of almost half the exam window. On the positive side, the support team was understanding, reset the environment, and even granted additional time to complete the exam.

The exam itself aligns well with the course objectives, requiring the creation of a concise and straightforward report. Emphasis is placed on meeting specific objectives for a red team engagement.
After submitting my report, I received feedback within just over three days, along with a passing result and an Accredible badge.

This course provides good value for money, particularly during promotions such as Black Friday or December discounts, where it was offered for as little as $10. The inclusion of two exam attempts further enhances its value.
The certification is ideal for beginners embarking on a journey into Offensive Security, Pentesting, or Red Teaming. It serves as an accessible challenge, simulating the enumeration and exploitation of externally exposed services and progressing into internal Active Directory environments.

Compared to other certifications like PNPT or OSCP, this course and exam is easier but still introduce valuable topics that were not covered in earlier certifications by TCM or OffSec. I appreciated the exam’s alignment with the study modules and its added complexity beyond the practice labs.

There is room for improvement in scheduling, in the content, lab connectivity and support readiness. I think that it should be possible for the student to schedule himself the exam date. The course content should be reviewed and the team should make sure that the documentation is completely aligned with the videos and the practice lab is equal to write-up, demonstration videos and the practice lab. And finally, in a 24 hour exam it's expected a 24 hour support window, despite that the support was very helpful.

For its price and content, this course delivers a well-rounded and affordable introduction to Red Teaming, making it a worthwhile option for aspiring cybersecurity professionals or anyone looking for a cheap lab to practice and own their AD skills.

## Tips
1. Setup Recommendations: Setup an Active Directory lab to study and test different attacks and enumeration techniques. My experience is that both this course and the PNPT help you configuring a lab for this purpose from start to end.
2. Course Material Insights: Very similar to the MCRTA course, the study material is essentially the slides from the video lessons, so focus on the videos for in-depth understanding.
3. Hints: I encourage you to setup your personal lab and train there before going to the lab provided by CWL. The 30 days provided are more than enough to clear the practice lab. Try to schedule the exam when you are very close to finish the practice lab. If you have the time and still did not, practice on HTB academy or THM related AD paths. Finally, make sure to screenshot all commands you executed and respective output so that you have everything ready for the reporting phase.
